## Cool stuff

## Project Selection or Proposal
We propose to build a GUI application for playing chess.
The app would allow you to play chess against a bot. We will probably
use stockfish as the engine, but we could also roll our own, much
worse bot. Additionally, if permitted, we can have online chess,
where two clients (the gui program) can connect to a server to allow
them to play against each other.
