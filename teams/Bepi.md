## Project Selection or Proposal
We propose to make a weather based game using information from weather api's.  The player will get weather information about a random location and then can guess by picking a location on a map.  The goal is to get as close to the actual location as possible.  The player can make an educated guess based on maps displaying different data about the weather.
