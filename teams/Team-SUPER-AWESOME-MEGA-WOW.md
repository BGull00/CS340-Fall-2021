## Cool stuff
Ideas: 
* Portable file/executable exported from our application with set combination of enhancements, drag any picture over it and our application performs those enhancements automatically and outputs it in the same directory
* Filters
* Basic adjustments such as contrast, brightness, saturation, etc.
* Steganography function to encrypt and decrypt messages within images

## Project Selection or Proposal
An image processing application that can access local files as well as images from an online database. Allows user to view images and preview enhancements. Multiple enhancements can be made and changes are saved in a timeline. Includes undo and redo functionality within this timeline. Images may be saved as image files or as a format to be used within the application. Images may be exported/converted to different image formats. Images can be renamed. Image metadata can be viewed and edited.
