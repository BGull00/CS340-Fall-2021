Proposed Team Idea:
 - We would like to create a wiki speed run game. Essentially, this would be an application where we create a timer and see how long it takes the player to go from one wiki page to another using only hyperlinks within the page. We will be outputting all the wiki information ourselves (since we can't embed a wiki page without our app). Something similiar (but web/mobile based), can be found at https://www.thewikigame.com.
